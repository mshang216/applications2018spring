	<h1>Jimmy</h1>
	<h2>Persona: Off-road/BMX bike enthusiast</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>As a BMX bike enthusiast, I want to look cool because I am an insecure tween</li>

		<li>As a BMX bike enthusiast, I want to be able to do tricks because otherwise it would just be a regular bike which is uncool and boring.</li>

		<li>As a BMX bike enthusiast, I want to make sure this bike does not break easily, because I am not a very experienced BMX rider and need it to practice.</li>

		<li>As a BMX bike enthusiast, I want to not spend a crap ton, because I currently work at Jimmy Johns and earn $8 an hour.</li>

		<li>As a BMX bike enthusiast, I want this bike to be worth my money, because I have saved up paychecks from delivering for Domino's all of last year and have sacrificed the latest video games.</li>

		<li>As a BMX bike enthusiast, I want to buy my bike from a website that looks cool because I feel they would have cooler products.</li>

		<li>As a BMX bike enthusiast, I want free shipping and/or other awesome deals so that I can feel good about my purchase. But also in the case where I have to return it I should be able to ship it back for free.</li>

		<li>As a BMX bike enthusiast, I want a bike fitting to my environment because I will most likely be practicing around my neighborhood (outdoors). I don't plan on racing so it doesn't have to be anything too fancy.</li>

		<li>As a BMX bike enthusiast, I want a frame that will fit my size because I want to be able to ride this comfortably.</li>

		<li>As a BMX bike enthusiast, I want colored wheels because it is a hip new trend.</li>

		<li>As a BMX bike enthusiast, I want a lighter bike because it looks like it would be easier to manipulate and begin practicing with.</li>
	</ul>
