<ul class="disc">
	<li>Here, we've provided space for skiers to customize for the most optimal ski experience by selecting the desired type of skis (as appropriate for the preferred ski category as well as a ski length-of-best-fit!)</li>
	<li>Note/Caution: This section is reserved for level III (advanced) and above only. Violation of this can result in serious injury or even death.</li>
	<li>The next following pages will allow you to select a specific type of skis as well as an optimal ski length. <s>{For more instructions on how to pick from each category, choose one of the options below}</s></li>

	<br />

	<li>Category/Terrain:</li>
	<ul class="circle">
		<li>All-Mountain</li>
		<ul class="square">
			<li>{"As the name suggests, all mountain skis are for skiing the entire mountain. They are designed to handle anything you throw at them including powder, ice, groomers, steeps, heavy snow, and everything in betwee, but they arenâ€™t necessarily a master of any one terrain or snow type... - evo.com}</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<ul class="circle">
		<li>Powder</li>
		<ul class="square">
			<li>{"If you like to find powder stashes at your local resort, go on backcountry missions for the freshest of fresh or heli ski trips to BC, powder skis are what you need to stay afloat...Many powder skis today are versatile enough to handle mixed conditions and harder snow." - evo.com}</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<ul class="circle">
		<li>Big Mountain</li>
		<ul class="square">
			<li>{"Big mountain skis are designed for charging big lines with high speeds and big airs. These skis vary in width from wide, powder-oriented skis for skiing Alaska spines to narrower, mixed condition skis for ripping the beat up headwall at your local mountain" - evo.com}</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<ul class="circle">
		<li>Carving</li>
		<li>Park and Pike / Freestyle</li>
		<li>Alpine Touring / Backcountry</li>
		<li>Racing</li>
		<li>Cross Country</li>
	</ul>

	<br />
	<li>Length: ___ [in], [cm]</li>
	<ul class="circle">
		<li>{"The truth is that there is no magic formula for determining the perfect size ski for every skier. Factors such as height and weight provide an excellent starting point but there are other things to consider. Ski category, snow type, terrain and personal preference are just some of the things to take into account. The general rule is to pick a ski length that is somewhere between your chin and the top of your head. Advanced and expert skiers may choose skis that are slightly longer than head height." - evo.com}</li>
		<li><s>{measurement chart?}</s></li>
		<li>{"REASONS TO SIZE YOUR SKIS SHORTER, CLOSER TO YOUR CHIN: "You are a beginner or intermediate skier; You weigh less than average for your height; You like to make short, quick turns and seldom ski fast; You want a carving ski with only camber, no rocker."}</li>
		<li>{"REASONS TO SIZE YOUR SKIS LONGER, CLOSER TO THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD: "You are skiing fast and aggressively; You weigh more than average for your height; You plan to do the majority of your skiing off the trail; You plan to ski a twin-tip ski; You want a ski that has a lot of rocker."}</li>
